Description
------------

This module sends html or plain text newsletters to the subscription list. At the end
of the newsletter, an unsubscribe link is provided. Subscription (and also
unsubscription) is managed through a block, or by an admin on the module's admin pages.
Sent newsletters are collected by taxonomy module, and a link to the term's page or the 
associated rss-feed can be displayed in the block. Not-sent newsletters are kept in the
Drafts folder. New newsletter types can be created to organize your newsletters. The
subscription list can be managed. Sending of large mailings can be managed by cron.
See INSTALL.txt for installation.
